# FootML

Built a machine learning platform for the 2020-2021 Fantasy Premier League Season. Completed as part of the Imperial College MSc Group Project. Worked in a team with 4 other individuals: Charlie Robertson, Katie Miles, Fraser Ralston and James Rosen. 

## Development

This platform was built using a Flask backend and a simple HTML / CSS frontend with injections of JavaScript. The 'platform' folder contains files pertaining to the web application and the 'MLmodels' folder contains files pertaining to the various machine learning models tested.

## Data Sources

The data sources for this platform include the [Fantasy Premier League API](https://fpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) and a publicly available FPL Github under the name [vastaav](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League).

## Deployment

The platform has been deployed at [FootML-FPL](http://footml-fpl.herokuapp.com/).
